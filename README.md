**Mayan Calendar** is an Android app that displays current date (or any date in Gregorian calendar) in [Mayan "Long Count" calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar). 

This app can convert any date in Gregorian Calendar into Long Count calendar and back. See app [Screenshots](screenshots).

## 2026 Update

I originally wrote this in 2010 for my Google G1 — the very first Android phone. It had a tiny screen and fairly limited UI capabilities,
but I still have good memories of working with it. While the app itself is very much of its time, the core logic is still relevant: 
the Mayan number glyph handling and calendar conversion code can be easily extracted and reused if that’s what you’re interested in.
